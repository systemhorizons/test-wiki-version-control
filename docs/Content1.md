Backdrop CMS is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use Content Management System for building professional websites.
Backdrop is a Content Management System. A CMS is a database driven website that allows people to log in, and with permission, allows them to edit nearly any page. Backdrop can be used to create almost any type of website. Use Backdrop CMS for everything from a single-administrator's personal blog site, to a complex, multi-role, business e-commerce platform. Backdrop is the perfect fit for comprehensive businesses, non-profit, educational, government or corporate websites.

Backdrop CMS is a tool for building websites. Backdrop's core is packed full of common features that 80% of all websites will use. Backdrop's world of Add-Ons can be used to meet less common requirements. Backdrop can be easily extended with the addition of modules (that change the way it works), themes (that change the way it looks), and layouts (that change where content can be placed on a page).

Backdrop CMS is a fork of Drupal. Backdrop is Drupal 7 -- modernized. Backdrop's founders and early contributors saw the huge changes coming to Drupal 8, and met the need to maintain and improve this wonderful software that has a proven track-record of success. By providing an easy upgrade from Drupal 7, Backdrop will be the most affordable next step for sites running on Drupal 7 today.

Backdrop CMS is non-profit. Backdrop is a project of the Software Freedom Conservancy. Software Freedom Conservancy is a not-for-profit charity that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.
