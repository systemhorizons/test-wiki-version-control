# Principles
## Easier updates
Backwards compatibility is important. Backdrop will attempt to keep API change to a minimum in order for contributed code to be maintained easily, and for existing sites to be updated affordably. Every big change that can't be made backwards compatible will need to be carefully considered, and measured against Backdrop's other principles:
## Simplicity
Write code for the majority. Backdrop will aim to be easy to learn and build upon, even for those with a minimal amount of technical knowledge. Direct implementations will be chosen over abstraction, and how things work should be immediately clear and easily documentable. While the more vocal parts of our community may be more experienced developers, we always need to keep in mind the developers who are newer to the project.

## Focus
Include features for the majority. Backdrop core should only include features and tools that benefit the majority of sites that are running it. When making decisions on how to move forward with future versions of Backdrop, we will include opinions of those who are not so vocal online. This means including opinions from individuals who attend trainings, meet-ups, and camps as well as real-world engagements with consumers of Backdrop.

## Extensibility
Ensure Backdrop can be extended. Backdrop aims to provide a powerful core that can be readily extended through custom or publicly available contributed modules. These additional modules can provide desired features that are not implemented in core due to their complexity or use cases that are too specific.

## Security
Keep sites and people safe. Backdrop core should include features that will keep websites, the data within, and the people that use them safe. The majority of security-hardening features should be enabled by default to protect those who know the least, but should not prevent people from going about their daily work.

## Speed and performance
Meet low system requirements. Backdrop must be able to run on affordable hosting with very basic requirements. Achieving this goal will mean not chasing popular trends in technology, but instead adopting common, proven, and learnable systems.

## Release on-time
Plan and schedule releases. Each release will contain a planned set of features, and will be released on time. If a feature is not ready in time for a specific release, the feature will get postponed, but the release will still be delivered on time. 

## Freedom
Remain Free and Open Source. Open Source has the ability to change the world for the better. All code included with Backdrop is under an Open Source license that allows anyone to use it free of charge, regardless of their beliefs or intentions. All code included with Backdrop has always been -- and always will be -- Free and Open Source.
